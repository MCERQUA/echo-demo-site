## To Complete Setup:

### 1. Run Database Schema (REQUIRED)

-- Copy entire contents of docs/supabase_schema.sql
```

2. Click the **"Edit"** button in the top right of each card
3. Click on any field to edit it
4. When done, click **"Save"** to persist changes

### 3. Test It Now:

2. Log in with your account
3. Navigate to "Brand Info" section
4. Click "Edit" button
5. Click on any field (e.g., Business Name)
6. Type your information

### 4. Data Structure:
The dashboard saves data to these Supabase tables:
- `business_info` - Company details
- `contact_info` - Contact information
- `brand_assets` - Branding elements
- `digital_presence` - Website data
- `social_media_accounts` - Social profiles
- `google_business_profile` - GMB data
- And 9 more tables for complete coverage

### 5. For Echo AI Integration:
Echo can now populate data using:
```javascript
// Research and populate business info
const websiteData = await firecrawl_scrape({ url: clientWebsite });
const businessInfo = extractBusinessInfo(websiteData);
await updateClientData('business_info', businessInfo);
```

## Troubleshooting:

### "Nothing happens when I click Edit"
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure database tables exist

### "Can't save data"
- Run the SQL schema first
- Check Supabase RLS policies
- Verify you're authenticated

### "No data showing"
- Data starts empty - add some!
- Check if tables were created
- Verify user authentication

## Next Steps:
1. Run the database schema
2. Test editing functionality
3. Start populating your data
4. Let Echo AI research and fill additional data

The dashboard is now a fully functional client information management system!
